                <li>If the map is running slowly for you, try toggling NSW. The map overlay is computationally expensive.</li>
                <li>Each state is split differently because I wanted to show the highest fidelity of data available. 
                    NSW is by postcode (which is what produces weird gaps and overlaps at the state borders), everywhere else is by Local Government Area.
                </li>
                <li>QLD used to be by Health and Hospital Service areas but The Guardian started releasing their scrape per LGA. 
                    Probably to normalise it against the other states I guess.
                </li>
                <li>You can grab the code or any assets used here like the mapping overlay data from this project's

                </li>
                <li>The number for each area represents the historical cumulative total of cases in the area. 
                    It's possible that on any given day of viewing that there has been a majority or complete recovery.
